			<p>My 1st degree Working kwalifications assist. was the 1st degree
			 <br>that I got. Getting this degree was to actually see if I would like to work in the IT.

			 		system Enigneering Could've done it in 1 year what the school did offer, but I didn't accept because I didn't want to miss out on the experience.</p>

			 		<p> After that I worked for a Lawyer as her P.A. and Techsupport for atleast 6 months, so I could gain experience outside of school.</p>

			 			<p> Right now I'm doing Webdesign and app develepment what is something very differnt to what I previously did, but so far is very exciting because you'll be learning new things everyday. </p>
